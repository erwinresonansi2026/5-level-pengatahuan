Framework of 5 Levels of Knowledge

Level 1: Observation and Basic Awareness

Focused on collecting facts and phenomena without deep interpretation.

Emphasizes direct attention to reality.

Example: Observing the movement of objects, patterns in nature, or raw data.


Level 2: Pattern Analysis and Relationships

Organizes relationships between data and phenomena, identifying correlations and patterns.

Begins simple abstraction, still tied to empirical reality.

Example: Basic statistics, direct cause-effect relationships, simple predictions.


Level 3: Conceptual Modeling and Prediction (current position of modern science)

Builds mathematical or conceptual models of phenomena to predict system behavior.

Focus on empirical accuracy, experimentation, and generalization.

Example: Laws of physics, quantum theory, climate models.


Level 4: Cross-Disciplinary Integration and Fundamental Cause Analysis

Investigates what underlies the cause, not just the observable effects or surface patterns.

Integrates consequential reflection, philosophy, and early ethical considerations to understand the foundations of phenomena.

Serves as a bridge to Level 5, considering origins, purpose, and implicit risks in concepts or experiments.

Example: Instead of only studying climate change (effects), examines the fundamental factors shaping the climate, including physical laws, cosmic interactions, and human influence.


Level 5: Conceptual and Moral-Spiritual Balance

Establishes the highest ethical boundary in science, maintaining balance between the created and the Creator.

Key principles:

1. Full freedom within the domain of creation: free to explore, understand, and measure phenomena among creations.


2. Respecting the Creator’s domain: avoid overstepping or claiming authority over aspects of existence that belong solely to the Creator.


3. Balance between knowledge and ethics: science may advance, but always with reflection on moral, spiritual, and social consequences.



Science becomes a means of integrative understanding, aligned with responsibility, spiritual awareness, and the principles of divinity.

Current Position Summary

Modern science: Predominantly at Level 3, with some approaches beginning to reach Level 4.

Levels 4–5: Represent the ethical boundary and moral reflection, guiding science to remain aligned with divine principles.
